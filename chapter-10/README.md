# CinéTrack — Chapter 10 Snapshot

Snapshot of CinéTrack at the end of Chapter 10: *Why AI Tools Fail in Real Codebases*.

## What changed in this chapter

No code changes. Chapter 10 is a diagnostic chapter that examines what goes wrong when you prompt without adequate context. The Review entity is introduced in the chapter as a failure example but not committed — it gets built correctly in chapter 11 with proper context.
